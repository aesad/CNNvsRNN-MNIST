# ðŸ§  Deep Learning: CNN vs RNN for MNIST Image Classification
This project compares **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and several **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architectures â€” including **LSTM**, **GRU**, and their bidirectional variants â€” on the **MNIST** handwritten digit dataset.
The goal is to analyze how spatial (CNN) and sequential (RNN family) models handle 2D image data.
