# üß† Deep Learning: CNN vs RNN for MNIST Image Classification

This project compares **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and several **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architectures ‚Äî including **LSTM**, **GRU**, and their bidirectional variants ‚Äî on the **MNIST** handwritten digit dataset.  
The goal is to analyze how spatial (CNN) and sequential (RNN family) models handle 2D image data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Project Stages

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation**
- MNIST images (28√ó28 grayscale) are normalized using the dataset mean and standard deviation:  
  ```python
  transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
  ```
- Train/test splits and DataLoaders created for efficient batching.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architectures**
Implemented models:
- `CNN`: Two convolutional layers + dropout + fully connected head  
- `RNN`: Vanilla RNN treating each image row (28 pixels) as a time step  
- `LSTM`: Long Short-Term Memory network to capture longer dependencies  
- `GRU`: Gated Recurrent Unit for computational efficiency  
- `BiRNN`, `BiLSTM`, `BiGRU`: Bidirectional variants aggregating forward and backward sequence information  

Each model ends with a fully connected layer + `log_softmax` output.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Training Setup**
```python
batch_size = 64
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 5
optimizer = Adam
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss
device = "cuda" if available else "cpu"
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy** and **Loss** on the train and test set  
- **Training Time** (in **minutes:seconds**, MM:SS) measured for performance comparison

**Observation:**  
- BiGRU shows excellent stability and efficiency, ranking second after CNN.  
- It combines fast training with strong bidirectional context learning.  

## üí¨ 4. Discussion

### **CNN:**
- Achieved the **highest accuracy (99.27%)** and **lowest loss** among all models.  
- CNNs are naturally suited for image data due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies through convolution and pooling layers.  
- However, training time is relatively longer due to convolutional operations.

### **RNN and Bidirectional RNN:**
- Performed **significantly worse** (96.1‚Äì96.7%) because vanilla RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies and are not ideal for 2D spatial patterns.
- Bidirectional RNN improved slightly but at a cost in training time.

### **LSTM and GRU Families:**
- **LSTM** and **GRU** achieved strong results (~98.6‚Äì98.9%) ‚Äî better than simple RNNs but below CNN.
- **BiLSTM** and **BiGRU** further improved performance by processing sequences in both directions.
- **BiGRU** reached a good balance between accuracy and efficiency, with slightly faster training than BiLSTM.

## üöÄ 5. Conclusions & Possible Improvements

| Observation | Suggestion |
|--------------|-------------|
| CNN dominates for spatial pattern recognition | Try deeper CNNs (e.g., ResNet, LeNet5+) |
| RNN-family models show potential but are less efficient | Replace with **ConvLSTM** or **Vision Transformers (ViT)** |
| Training time varies greatly | Use **mixed precision** and **smaller hidden sizes** to speed up |
| All models use default hyperparameters | Perform **hyperparameter tuning** (e.g., Optuna, RayTune) |
